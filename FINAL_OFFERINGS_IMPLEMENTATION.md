  → Same as collapsed
  → Full description below divider
```

### 2. **Category Navigation**

```

### 3. **Search Functionality**
```

- Icon and placeholder text
- Ready for search implementation
```

### 4. **Interaction Design**
```
- Tap category header → expand/collapse category

- Tap "Collapse" → collapse all items
- Tap category chip → scroll to category
```
