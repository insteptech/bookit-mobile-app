# Token Refresh Navigation Fix Implementation

## Overview
This implementation fixes the token refresh mechanism to automatically redirect users to the login screen when refresh tokens are invalid or expired.

## Problem Solved
Previously, when refresh tokens became invalid, the app would clear the tokens but the user would remain on the current screen without any indication. Users had to manually navigate or restart the app to reach the login screen.

## Solution Components

### 1. Navigation Service (`/lib/core/services/navigation_service.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Provides global navigation capabilities outside the widget tree
- **Key Features**:
  - Static methods for navigation from anywhere in the app
  - Support for GoRouter-based navigation
  - Fallback mechanisms using navigator key
  - Methods: `navigateToLogin()`, `navigateTo()`, `pushTo()`, `goBack()`

### 2. Enhanced Auth Interceptor (`/lib/core/services/remote_services/network/auth_interceptor.dart`)
- **Updated `_handleAuthFailure()` method**:
  - Clears both access and refresh tokens
  - Clears user details from storage
  - **NEW**: Automatically navigates to login screen using `NavigationService.navigateToLogin()`

### 3. App Initialization (`/lib/app/app.dart`)
- **Added navigation service initialization**:
  - Imports `NavigationService`
  - Initializes the service with the router instance in `build()` method
  - Ensures the navigation service has access to the GoRouter

### 4. Enhanced Splash Screen (`/lib/features/splash/presentation/splash_sceen.dart`)
- **Added error handling**:
  - Wraps API calls in try-catch blocks
  - Redirects to login screen if any API call fails (indicating invalid tokens)
  - Provides better user experience for token-related failures

## How It Works

### Token Refresh Flow
1. **API Request with Expired Token** → 401 error received
2. **Auth Interceptor Triggered** → Attempts to refresh token using refresh token
3. **Refresh Token Valid** → New tokens saved, original request retried
4. **Refresh Token Invalid** → `_handleAuthFailure()` called:
   - Clears all tokens and user data
   - **Calls `NavigationService.navigateToLogin()`**
   - User is automatically redirected to login screen

### Navigation Service Usage
```dart
// From anywhere in the app (services, interceptors, etc.)
NavigationService.navigateToLogin();  // Redirect to login
NavigationService.navigateTo('/home_screen');  // Navigate to any route
NavigationService.pushTo('/settings');  // Push new route
```

## Key Benefits
1. **Automatic Logout**: Users are immediately redirected when authentication fails
2. **Better UX**: No manual navigation required when tokens expire
3. **Global Access**: Navigation available from any service or interceptor
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Multiple fallback mechanisms for navigation
5. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with dedicated navigation service

## Testing Scenarios
To test this implementation:

1. **Expired Access Token**: Make API request with expired access token
   - Should automatically refresh if refresh token is valid
   - Should redirect to login if refresh token is invalid

2. **Invalid Refresh Token**: Manually invalidate refresh token in storage
   - Any subsequent API call should redirect to login screen

3. **Network Issues During Refresh**: Simulate network failure during token refresh
   - Should redirect to login screen

4. **App Restart with Invalid Tokens**: Start app with invalid tokens
   - Splash screen should catch API errors and redirect to login

## Files Modified
- `/lib/core/services/navigation_service.dart` (NEW)
- `/lib/core/services/remote_services/network/auth_interceptor.dart`
- `/lib/app/app.dart`
- `/lib/features/splash/presentation/splash_sceen.dart`

## Dependencies
- Uses existing GoRouter setup
- Compatible with current token service implementation
- No additional package dependencies required

## Notes
- The navigation service uses static methods for global access
- Print statements are included for debugging (should be replaced with proper logging in production)
- The implementation is backwards compatible with existing navigation patterns
