# Token Refresh Implementation - Fixed Issues

## Overview
Fixed the token refresh mechanism in the Bookit Mobile App to properly handle expired access tokens by automatically refreshing them using refresh tokens.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Circular Dependency in AuthInterceptor**
- **Problem**: The `AuthInterceptor` was using the same `dio` instance for refresh calls, causing infinite loops
- **Solution**: Created a separate `refreshInstance` in `DioClient` without auth interceptor for refresh calls

### 2. **Missing Refresh Token Endpoint**
- **Problem**: Auth interceptor was using hardcoded `/auth/refresh-token` path
- **Solution**: Added `refreshTokenEndpoint` constant in `endpoint.dart`

### 3. **Improved AuthInterceptor Logic**
- **Problem**: Race conditions and inadequate error handling
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `_isRefreshing` flag to prevent concurrent refresh attempts
  - Better error handling and token cleanup
  - Proper retry mechanism for failed requests
  - More robust path checking to avoid refresh loops

### 4. **Inconsistent Token Handling**
- **Problem**: Some authentication methods weren't saving refresh tokens
- **Solution**: Updated `verifyOTP` and `resendOtp` methods to save both access and refresh tokens

### 5. **API Provider Dio Configuration**
- **Problem**: `APIRepository` was creating its own Dio instance instead of using centralized `DioClient`
- **Solution**: Updated to use `DioClient.instance` for consistency

### 6. **AuthStorageService Error Handling**
- **Problem**: Incorrect null checks for `getUserDetails()` method
- **Solution**: Used proper try-catch blocks since the method throws exceptions instead of returning null

## Files Modified

1. **`/lib/core/services/remote_services/network/dio_client.dart`**
   - Added `refreshInstance` for refresh token calls
   - Updated `_createDio` to use refresh instance in AuthInterceptor

2. **`/lib/core/services/remote_services/network/auth_interceptor.dart`**
   - Added race condition prevention with `_isRefreshing` flag
   - Improved error handling and token cleanup
   - Better retry mechanism
   - Added proper import for endpoint constants

3. **`/lib/core/services/remote_services/network/endpoint.dart`**
   - Added `refreshTokenEndpoint` constant

4. **`/lib/core/services/remote_services/network/auth_api_service.dart`**
   - Updated `verifyOTP` to save refresh tokens
   - Updated `resendOtp` to save refresh tokens

5. **`/lib/core/services/remote_services/network/api_provider.dart`**
   - Updated to use centralized `DioClient.instance`
   - Fixed `getUserDetails()` error handling
   - Removed unused imports

## How It Works

1. **Request Flow**: All API requests go through `AuthInterceptor` which adds access token to headers
2. **401 Detection**: When server returns 401 (token expired), interceptor catches it
3. **Refresh Process**: 
   - Uses refresh token to get new access/refresh tokens
   - Updates stored tokens
   - Retries original request with new access token
4. **Error Handling**: If refresh fails, clears all tokens (forces re-login)
5. **Race Condition Prevention**: `_isRefreshing` flag ensures only one refresh happens at a time

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test token expiration scenarios
2. Test concurrent requests during token refresh
3. Test refresh token expiration handling
4. Test network errors during refresh process
5. Verify proper logout when refresh fails

## Benefits

- ✅ Seamless user experience (no forced logouts on token expiry)
- ✅ Proper error handling and recovery
- ✅ Prevention of infinite refresh loops
- ✅ Consistent token management across the app
- ✅ Thread-safe refresh process
